                they say conversation with a friend as short as 12 minutes is enough to make u feel less alone. when I saw that quote, the only person that came to my mind was you. it basically sums up the last 6 years of our friendship tbh. anything that has the word friend in it will remind me of you. if there's anything about "what your zodiac signs say about you" or any "if u were born in this date" mentioned , its become a habit for me to check yours. yeah we both know it's stupid but it shows how much ur a part of in my life. I truly don't belive or know if any romantic relationship can top this. our bond is that unbreakable. it's honestly something my mind can't register how I'll have to be closer to another person than you at some point in life. I can't belive that I used to get insecure about losing this, maybe it was valid at that point of time but I can't even imagine one of us going away from this. its always gonna be you who I call when the world gets a bit too heavy. ur that light which my darkness needs and I hope I am too for you. I honestly thought I was gonna run out of things to say since we've been doing this for so many years but ill never run out of things to say when it's about you . one thing I love about you is that you support my rights and u DONT support my wrongs .even though it may feel shitty at times , that's what I truly need. another thing i really admire about you is that ur unapologetically yourself, u have such strong morals that you are not easily affected when something bad happens. and i dont mean that u dont get sad, obviously you do, i mean you are a person after all but you do not let all that bad energy leave an impact or change the way you think. you really are one of the best people I know. ur such a force and u have the capability to become whoever you want to be. we've been apart for more years than we've been together but if it did anything its that it has brought us closer. so whatever happens or whenever u feel a bit like "I can't do this" just know that ull always have my 12 mins no matter what. I love you so much  biyona.  happy birthday <3
             I realise this message is wayy too gay, like no man is ever getting anything like this out of me  but wtv
